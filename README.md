# BreathCalcificationSummer2023
Here is the repository containing the code I worked on during my internship in HMU-ISCA LAB (Greece) from June to August 2023

This project focus on Calcification detection in mammograms using deep learning models. My task is after making a little state of the art and understanding the problems involved, making a short presentation about it :

Then to focus on microcalcification shaped like dots/clusters of dots: detecting them and being able to derive statistics such as the size of these clusters, their shape, the distance separating them, etc. 

In order to achieve this, we start from an existing code for the detection of microcalcifications in the form of dots ("Segmenting Microcalcifications in Mammograms and its Applications") and we try to apply to it the study of distributions carried out in "Feature-driven Local Cell Graph (FLocK): New Computational Pathology-based Descriptors for Prognosis of Lung Cancer and HPV Status of Oropharyngeal Cancers"

Then if I succeed maybe, thanks to a radiologist's diagnoses, to see if it is possible to make a diagnosis based on these characteristics, or at least extracting information from those characteristices.
